                    <p class="section__content">We teamed up with AristanderAI to build a strong digital strategy that would allow them to be recognisable and competitive in the market. Like any other company that starts up, they needed a digital business card that provides crucial information, serves as a contact point and helps acquire new partners.</p>

                    <p class="section__content">Working alongside the AristanderAI team allowed me to understand the product's perspectives, established requirements and priorities. I created the information architecture and interaction model, which provide a clear picture of what the website needed to contain.</p>
                    <p class="section__content">Due to time constraints and the project's size, it was impossible to launch the whole website at once. Therefore, we decided to focus on bite-sized steps and 2-week iterations. Individual parts were planned in sprints that eventually add up to the original goal.</p>
